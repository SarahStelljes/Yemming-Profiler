# Yemming-Profiler
## About
Yemming Profiler is an app that generates an html that shows info on each member of a team. The team is made by the user by answering questions via the app.

## Motivation
The motivation for making this product was to learn how to do OOP and to try to put everything else that I had learned so far into practice.

## Problems Solved
It makes it easier for team data to be uploaded and build a small website based on the inputed data.

## What I learned
I learned how to make OOP tests with jest, and had to brush up on previous lessons so I knew how to do the things I needed to for this project.

## How to Use
This app requires NodeJS to run. Upon starting the app, questions for a team manager will appear first. All you have to do is answer them (make sure you have your info ready)! After that you will be taken to a menu and then you choose an option. Depending on what you choose, there will be another series of questions. Answer all of them and reapet until you have added all team members!
